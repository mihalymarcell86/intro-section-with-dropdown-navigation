## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS using BEM
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this project to experiment with the "checkbox-hack". I found that this technique has more limitations than advantages:

- Form controls are not used as intended, hence they break the semantics of the HTML.
- Form controls' functionality is too restricted to solve more complex issues, _e.g._, radio buttons cannot be unselected, checkboxes cannot be configured so that only one of a group can be checked, etc.
- The overcomplicated CSS selectors jumble up specificity and thus defeat one of the key benefits of using BEM.

Ultimately I actualised the submenus with the above technique and used vanilla JavaScript to patch up the code.
The side panel was made mostly using JavaScript.

I was debating with myself whether the navbar interaction should be hover or click. I did some research and found some useful articles (see below) that broadened my understanding. I decided to implement click-driven dropdowns.

---

I realized, how the `min()` / `max()` / `clamp()` functions can be used to reduce the amount of media queries in CSS, I used them composed with my `lerp()` function to effect liquid layout.
